 * Get a DeclarationEntry along with its explicitly declared Attributes.
 *
 * DeclarationEntry does not have a method for getting Attributes by default,
 * because an attribute declared on any DeclarationEntry affects all others,
 * and attributes really belong to the declared variable rather than the
 * declaration itself.
 *
 * In order to support this rule, we find for each attribute
 * - A declaration entry which
 * - corresponds to a variable associated with this attribute
 * - is in the same file as this attribute
 * - has identifier location after the attribute declaration
 * - has no other declaration entry between this one and the attribute.
 *
 * This should give us a highly reliable means of finding which attributes are
 * associated with which `DeclarationEntry`s.
 *
 * One note of caution: the associated `Variable` must be treated with caution,
 * as there are multiple instances of that `Variable` if it is declared
 * multiple times, they equal each other, and `getLocation()` on each variable
 * returns every location result. This class must act on `DeclarationEntry`s to
 * deliver reliable results.
