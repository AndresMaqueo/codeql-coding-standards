 - `RULE-8-13` - `PointerShouldPointToConstTypeWhenPossible.ql`
   - Exclude false positives where a variable occurs in a file compiled multiple times, but where it may only be const in some of those scenarios.
   - Exclude results for local scope variables in functions that use assembly code, as CodeQL cannot determine the impact of the assembly.
   - Exclude false positives when an assignment is made to a struct field.
   - Exclude false positives where the object pointed to by the variable is modified using `*p++ = ...`.
   - Exclude false positives for functions without bodies.
